/**

 * @short_description: Object representing a shaping plan
 * @include: hb.h
 *
 * Shape plans are not used for shaping directly, but can be access to query
 * certain information about how shaping will perform given a set of input
 * parameters (script, language, direction, features, etc.)
 * Most client would not need to deal with shape plans directly.
